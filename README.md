## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I encountered a challenge with the audio playing. The buttons would also remain lit per turn. I continously compared my code to the project spec for two days. I then contacted Code Path's team and was able to resolve my issue. My code was correct, however I was using Safari which was not compatible for this project. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Are most webpages just a combination of html and css? Is it literally just paragraphs and header put together? How do you imput user data into a webpage and constantly update said user data?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours, I would work on implementing levels to this game. Once you complete a level more buttons will appear. I would also have more than one sound played per each cycle.]
